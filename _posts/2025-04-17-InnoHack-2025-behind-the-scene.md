> Since this was the college's first hackathon, hopefully you won't have to put in that much effort as we did.

## Documents we used:

- [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDvkzSpXrq7r0VA2dOCWC9owiCDmjtYYuDJRowySWas/view)
- [Rules, Time Lines and To-Dos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YbXWt12ss_ly0k98OVIWFPnyhNJmrwfCnyykwHynTVg/view)
- [Team Registration Sheet & Allocation Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bCRchedb_cxoPeR7CwmX6aTcTxMdMgcIa90zupngHds/view)

## Steps we followed:

- Gather organizing teams of 3 or more. At Least one must have experience of participating in hackathons, and one with experience of organizing events, outgoing and who is able to speak up to administration and teachers.
- Firstly you need to coordinate with teachers and higher ups .For us, we talked with Bibek sir, the Bd head and Abinav sir. 
- Then you have to write a proposal to the SSD(Student service department ). I would suggest consulting with teachers. Better to consult with one who holds higher positions like Sandeep Gurung sir or any other sir /mam. Proposal contains details about how the event will be,everything including its structure and expenses.
- Once the proposal is approved, send “registration opening soon” and “registration opened” mails to all students. Go to classes individually to let everyone know about the event. Most tend to have many queries. We have to clear them and encourage everyone to participate.
- Ask BD through student services for social media posts, banners, posters, certificates, stickers and id cards from college.
- Hold meetings among organizers to List Tasks and allocate them to volunteers. 
- When discussing timelines, everyone needs to be on time but its not always possible to be on time so I prefer a 30 min to 1 hour of slack time between two events.
- Complete one tasks after another. 
- Day before the event, call volunteers, brief them about their tasks and ask them to prepare rooms for the next day. Create a whatsapp group for communication.
- Always have someone on stand by as you might need to go outside of the college sometimes
- We do send emails to all participants but it's necessary we follow up with an Call 

## Design Materials

> We need to mention more about the designs /videos and posters. This is where we messed up a little because we were unaware about how college administration handles them.
{: .prompt-info }

- The college doesn’t allow us to create any sort of design by ourselves. They have a whole design team in KTM and they are the ones that are gonna provide design to you. These include stickers, Posters, banners, social media post, certificate, id card and all.
- You can however give a design as a reference. So I would suggest providing some reference and give details rather than trying to make your own design. 
- Only thing that you can freely decide upon are stickers. Provide BD with sticker files. They will have them printed.
- The college does allow you to make a video and post it so if you have any ideas or want to make a video yourself ,you can do it (Keep in mind its need to be approved by the bd first.)
- Now, for the design, your proposal needs to be approved. They suggest a 2 week prior notice for the design request. We send our proposal to the SSD if the SSD approves of it then only will the send the request to BD department which they will send to the KTM design team.
