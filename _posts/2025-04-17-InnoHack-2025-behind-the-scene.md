> Since this was the college's first hackathon, hopefully you won't have to put in that much effort as we did.

## Documents we used:

- [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDvkzSpXrq7r0VA2dOCWC9owiCDmjtYYuDJRowySWas/view)
- [Rules, Time Lines and To-Dos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YbXWt12ss_ly0k98OVIWFPnyhNJmrwfCnyykwHynTVg/view)
- [Team Registration Sheet & Allocation Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bCRchedb_cxoPeR7CwmX6aTcTxMdMgcIa90zupngHds/view)

## Steps we followed:

- Gather organizing teams of 3 or more. At Least one must have experience of participating in hackathons, and one with experience of organizing events, outgoing and who is able to speak up to administration and teachers.
- First, a proposal had to be made. Coordinate with teachers and higher ups. For us, we talked with Bibek sir, the Bd head and Abinav sir. Better to consult with one who holds higher positions like Sandeep Gurung sir.
- Proposal contains details about how the event will be, everything including its structure and expenses. The budget stuff had to be super tight. Like, every little thing had to be noted down — how much posters would cost, how many would be needed, how many people were gonna show up, stuff like that. Basically, a lot of tiny details had to be figured out. The proposal had to be filled with all those tiny numbers — every single rupee had to be written down. Since it was our first time doing something like this, the proposal had to be changed a bunch of times. Mistakes were caught, stuff was missed, and lots of edits were done before it finally looked good.
-  Once the proposal is approved, send “registration opening soon” and “registration opened” mails to all students. Go to classes individually to let everyone know about the event. Most tend to have many queries. We have to clear them and encourage everyone to participate.
- Ask BD through student services for social media posts, banners, posters, certificates, stickers and id cards from college.
- Hold meetings among organizers to List Tasks and allocate them to volunteers. 
- Complete one task after another. 
- When discussing timelines, everyone needs to be on time but its not always possible to be on time so I prefer a 30 min to 1 hour of slack time between two events.
- Day before the event, call volunteers, brief them about their tasks and ask them to prepare rooms for the next day. Create a whatsapp group for communication.
- We do send emails to all participants but it's necessary we follow up with an Call. 
- During event, always have someone on stand by as you might need to go outside of the college sometimes

_One big thing to keep in mind — just be prepared. Questions are gonna be thrown at you left and right — like, “What’s this for?” or “Why’s this even needed?” So it helps a lot if everything is already thought through and you actually know what you’re trying to pull off._

## Design Materials

> We need to mention more about the designs /videos and posters. This is where we messed up a little because we were unaware about how college administration handles them.
{: .prompt-info }

- The college doesn’t allow us to create any sort of design by ourselves. They have a whole design team in KTM and they are the ones that are gonna provide design to you. These include stickers, Posters, banners, social media post, certificate, id card and all.
- You can however give a design as a reference. So I would suggest providing some reference and give details rather than trying to make your own design. 
- Only thing that you can freely decide upon are stickers. Provide BD with sticker files. They will have them printed.
- The college does allow you to make a video and post it so if you have any ideas or want to make a video yourself ,you can do it (Keep in mind its need to be approved by the bd first.)
- Now, for the design, your proposal needs to be approved. They suggest a 2 week prior notice for the design request. We send our proposal to the SSD if the SSD approves of it then only will the send the request to BD department which they will send to the KTM design team.
