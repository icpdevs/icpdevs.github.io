# Theme
"Smart Campus Solutions - Building a Better College Experience"
_Develop app/software to improve campus life of student, administration, or student engagement._

It was clearly stated that judges aren't looking for a complete project from teams. Teams should first focus on building a functional prototype of the core proposed solution. Hence, features like login/signup aren't that integral and can be implemented later if they have got time. 

# Participation
- 30 teams registered.
- 27 teams appeared at event while 3 ditched.
- 22 teams pitched while 5 gave up.
