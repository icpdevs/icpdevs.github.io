## Weekly Developers' Session

We started off with weekly developers' session where each week a stuednt share what little they know about certain topics. For that, we first got [the proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ibm3R-jSuUXLpxvmpz_sCSL17XB4lDU/view?usp=sharing) approved. We later added dev@ email in requirements to the proposal and got it signed by ceo sir. Then sent an email from student services to all BIT students:

Action Required: Developers' Community Application Form

```
Dear applicant,
We are really happy to see your application for the developer's community. But it was really sad to see that you have not completed the task provided for the registration.

We do support your interest and are hoping to work with you, so we would like you to make necessary changes in your github profile before the application deadline: April 1 (Tuesday).

Your github profile should look something like this or this. Make sure your intro text also appears on your github profile.

Your intro must have these points:
  - A little about yourself
  - Your likes, interests and hobbies.
  - What you know: your skills
  - Why you want to join the Developers' Community

Otherwise, we are afraid your application will be considered invalid. The readme file can be updated as much as you want before the deadline. You do not have to re-submit the form. So, we hope you will provide an answer to help us know about you, your reasons and ideas to be in this community.

> When sending mass emails, keep receivers' addresses in BCC and always CC studentservices, respected CEO and community supervisor. But sometimes, for example, when sending selection emails, its better to disclose receivers as it is only for a closed group and everyone can see their friends in the list which encourages them a bit. Strictly use BCC on rejection and other negative mails.

Developer's Community Weekly Progress Meeting

```
Hello everyone,

How's the seat plan system cooking?
We will be having an optional weekly progress meeting on April 8, Tuesday 3PM @ Tilicho. Progress meeting is where we share our progress on the project: what we have done and what problem we faced.

You can join the meeting if you want to get ideas on how other developers are solving the tasks. Also, if you are facing any issues, we will try to solve them together in this meeting.
```

## Host submissions

_Added the [20 submissions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvK2c2myjo03QqY6rAmJfEHWSOzjUpJIjbpUfeAm9wI/edit?usp=sharing) to our [projects repo](https://github.com/icpdevelopers/projects) and made them browsable with [directory listing](https://icpdevelopers.github.io/projects/tree/2025/seat-plan-submissions/)_ 

## Pick core team members

We cannot have all of 20 in core team. The core team needs to be small and active to maintain speed and efficiency. Hence, based on potential contribution from each member, a core team of 6 is selected.

> At this point, we have multiple groups: general members (those who submitted the community registration task), core team candidates (those who submitted core team selection task) and the core team members (whose submission got selected). The path for core team is pretty clear i.e. build projects. But the path for other groups is yet to be decided on.
